Watch this space;-)\n2021 AwesomeBlade Software\nPlatforms: PC, Mac, Linux (+ potentially others)\nIn 2021, 8-Bit Apocalypse appeared on Kickstarter as a very cool and interesting indie project from developer Ricardo Jorge. The game was a modern homage to arcade classics and dystopian sci-fi, blending aesthetics of 1980s pop culture with fast-paced action, a deep backstory, and an original synth soundtrack.\n\nThe game was essentially to be top down twin stick shooter action game, where players take control of a mysterious lone soldier fighting to survive in a post-apocalyptic cyberpunk world ruled by corporate tyranny and crawling with enemies – from mutated beasts to military robots.\n1984 Star Systems Software\nPlatform: Atari 400/800\nA short entry for a title that was created by Russ Wetmore, and one of the last games they worked on before moving onto new platforms. Unfortunately the game was never released, but thankfully it was recovered in 2015 via the AtariAge forums and Kay Savetz.\n\nHere is what Russ had to say about the game:\n1984 Star Systems Software\nPlatform: Atari 400/800\nDid you know that Preppie was meant to have been a trilogy? Neither did we – though thanks to Avram Dumitrescu, we learn that back in 2005 it was established that Russ Wetmore was planning to create a 3rd game called Preppies in Space thanks to an interview.\nAvram not long afterwards got some more details directly from Russ:\nThanks to Sailor of Triad, a rare prototype of Alien 3 for the Commodore 64 has just been discovered recently. This was a demo that was seemingly produced for producer Joe Bonar to take a look at back in the day to see progress with the project.\n\nIt is possible that it could have been also passed onto magazines for screenshots – which makes it a shame that it wasn’t included as a demo on the likes of Commodore Force or Format at the time.\nCarts of Fury is a 2007 Canadian Tire Flash-based advergame that was once available online, and then even given out as physical CD-ROM copies about a year later. It is no longer available today (not currently on Flashpoint Archive) and was yet to be preserved until now.\n\nThanks to a contributor who wishes to remain anonymous, a physical copy was acquired and digitally preserved, and we have now uploaded everything here and to Archive.org. Details about the game are thanks to them:\n1993 Enigma Variations\nPlatform: Gameboy Original\nAlso known as: The Adventures of Dr. Franken: Part 3\nOur next entry into the GTW archives is a surprise 3rd title in the Dr. Franken series which was being developed on the Nintendo Gameboy by Enigma Variations. However, when you look at the prototype we have recovered, you wouldn’t think it was the same series.\n\nThe 3rd game it seems was to take a very different direction, and had Dr. Franken heading off into space and travelling around to different planets to carry out certain puzzles to then escape to the next planet, and so on. We’re not sure exactly what the story-line was at this stage.\n1999 Anarchy Arts\nPlatform: PC\nAlso known as: Shogo: Mobile Armor Division Expansion Pack – Legacy of the Fallen\nLegacy of the Fallen was an ambitious add-on pack developed by Anarchy Arts as an expansion for the 1998 first-person shooter Shogo: Mobile Armor Division. The project began in late 1998 after Monolith Productions, the creators of Shogo, approached Anarchy Arts with an offer to develop the add-on. For the relatively young and unknown studio, this was an exciting opportunity to make a name and earn revenue, so they accepted.\n\nAnarchy Arts operated initially as a virtual company with team members scattered worldwide, but the scale of the project led them to consolidate in Salt Lake City, Utah. There, the core team of about ten people, including programmers, level designers, and artists lived and worked intensely for seven months in a cramped three bedroom apartment, putting in long hours to bring Legacy of the Fallen to life. The development was powered by Monolith’s LithTech engine, which the team praised for its flexibility despite some early challenges.\n1989 Actual Screenshots\nPlatform: Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64 (GTW64 entry)\nThe Last Stuntman was a game that was due for release from one of CRL’s sub-labels in the late 1980s via Actual Screenshots. Little is known at this stage apart from that the game was split into 6 parts in total – mini-games essentially that were developed by different developers.\n\nAlan Botwright worked on the Commodore 64 edition, which is where we first heard of it – however, thanks to Brendan Phoenix, a rare screenshot from the 16-bit editions was located in Amiga Action issue 1. This shows the last level where you must jump from a plane and fight for a parachute in mid-air.\nToday we add a very different and early prototype of World Class Rugby for the Super Nintendo, dated from July 1992, and some time before the final release. The engine seems quite different from the final version, with completely different sprites and a different pace about the game.\n\nWhen starting the prototype, it begins with a 2.5D viewpoint and kicks off a demo game, but pressing start on the control pad will flip you to a Mode 7 tilted viewpoint to play the game. You can control the blue set of players, kick the ball and take part in scrum and other actions within the game.\nDISCLAIMER: We are a non-profit digitisation project, aiming to digitally preserve software and history which would otherwise be lost for good.

He emphasizes that while his success wasn’t overnight, the strategies he used are repeatable. The video is structured around a five-step framework.\nThe Five-Step Framework\n\nSet up your LinkedIn as a landing page: Optimize your profile to convert visitors.\nFive proven LinkedIn posts: Use specific post formats to grow followers and attract clients.\nPre-validated content: Leverage content ideas that are already proven to be successful.\nHow to sell on LinkedIn: Learn the best methods for selling, segmenting your audience, and retaining customers.\nBonus - The 2025 LinkedIn Algorithm Report: A free resource with tips and tricks to boost your content’s performance.\n\nKey Takeaways from the Video\n\n\nOptimizing Your LinkedIn Profile:\n\nProfile Picture: Use a high-quality, 400x400 pixel headshot that is approachable and uses your brand’s colors.\nBanner: Keep it simple and bold, with visuals that reflect your brand and a clear call-to-action, such as a link to your newsletter.\nHeadline: Your headline is critical as it appears with every post and comment you make. Use a proven template to clearly state who you are, who you help, and how you do it.\n“About” Section: Tell a relatable story about your professional journey, including struggles and successes. This section should also have a clear call-to-action to your website or newsletter.\nFeatured Section: Showcase your top offers with 2-3 call-to-action links, such as a newsletter sign-up or a product waitlist.\n\n\n\nThe Five Types of LinkedIn Posts:\n\nThe Awareness Post: Use pre-validated, easily shareable ideas to get traction and attention.\nThe Personal Story Post: Build a deeper connection with your audience by sharing relatable personal stories.\nThe Education Post: Provide value by teaching your audience something new. This is a crucial and often overlooked post type.\nThe Conversion Post: Convert followers into customers by sharing case studies, testimonials, and success stories.\nThe “How We Do It” Post: Differentiate yourself by showcasing your unique methodology and intellectual property.\n\n\n\nContent and Sales Strategy:\n\nPre-validated Content: To ensure your content performs well, use ideas and topics that have already proven to be popular.\nThe SERVE Method for Selling: Instead of selling, focus on serving your audience.\n\nShow up consistently.\nEducate.\nRelate to their needs.\nValue relationships over transactions.\nEngage with authenticity.\n\n\nSocial Selling and Direct Messages: Use LinkedIn filters to find your target audience, react to their posts with thoughtful comments, and connect with a personalized message.\nLead Magnets: Offer free, high-value resources (like cheat sheets or ebooks) to capture emails and warm up leads for future sales. This allows you to “deplatform” your audience by moving them to your own email list.\nSegmentation and Personalization: Once you have an email list, segment your audience based on their needs and interests to deliver tailored content and offers.\n\n\n"},"Digital-Garden/Garden-Index":{"slug":"Digital-Garden/Garden-Index","filePath":"Digital Garden/Garden Index.md","title":"Garden Index","links":["Digital-Garden/About-me/Resume","Digital-Garden/Creator-Resources/How-To-GROW-FAST-On-LinkedIn"],"tags":[],"content":"About me\nResume\nCreator Resources\nHow To GROW FAST On LinkedIn"},"Digital-Garden/Home":{"slug":"Digital-Garden/Home","filePath":"Digital Garden/Home.md","title":"Home","links":["Digital-Garden/Garden-Index"],"tags":[],"content":"Yohanes Fikru\nGame Developer • Studio Co-Founder • Systems Thinker\n\nWelcome to my digital garden — a living collection of notes, experiments, and reflections on game development, creativity, systems, and tech.\nBuilt with Obsidian and a love for messy, evolving ideas.\nRather than a polished blog, this space is a work-in-progress —\nyou’ll find seeds, sketches, and slow-growing thoughts side by side.\nEnter the Garden\nYou can find me with the following links LinkedIn GitHub Instagram\n\n🌱 Hand-grown with Obsidian\n📡 Hosted on Netify\n© Yohanes Fikru"},"Digital-Garden/Projects":{"slug":"Digital-Garden/Projects","filePath":"Digital Garden/Projects.md","title":"Projects","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Digital-Garden/Projects/Clash-of-Devs":{"slug":"Digital-Garden/Projects/Clash-of-Devs","filePath":"Digital Garden/Projects/Clash of Devs.md","title":"Clash of Devs","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Digital-Garden/Projects/Goteb":{"slug":"Digital-Garden/Projects/Goteb","filePath":"Digital Garden/Projects/Goteb.md","title":"Goteb","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Digital-Garden/Projects/Lomi":{"slug":"Digital-Garden/Projects/Lomi","filePath":"Digital Garden/Projects/Lomi.md","title":"Lomi","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"EG-Publishers/GASS/GASS-MVP-Session":{"slug":"EG-Publishers/GASS/GASS-MVP-Session","filePath":"EG Publishers/GASS/GASS MVP Session.md","title":"GASS MVP Session","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"✅ 1.

The structure is modular and allows for flexibility based on global headlines or planned scenarios.\nPhase 1: Briefing &amp; World Setup (20 minutes)\n\nThe Chairperson introduces the week’s scenario, which reflects real-world tensions (e.g., regional conflicts, climate agreements, cyberattacks, resource shortages).\nEach participant receives a quick brief on their country/entity’s current position, interests, resources, and constraints.\nAlliances and previous session impacts (if applicable) are acknowledged.\n\nPhase 2: Strategic Planning &amp; Negotiation (30 minutes)\n\nPlayers form alliances, make deals, exchange intel, or set up multilateral talks.\nBilateral or multilateral discussions are encouraged in breakout formats.\nThis phase may include secret messages or back-channel diplomacy (optional, depending on format).\n\nPhase 3: General Assembly / Crisis Response (30 minutes)\n\nEach representative speaks on their proposed action or stance (2-3 min max).\nJoint resolutions, declarations, or responses to the scenario are drafted.\nEmergency motions or vetoes may be introduced.\nReal-time developments (like surprise attacks or market crashes) may be introduced by the Chairperson based on dice rolls or cards (Risk-style twist).\n\nPhase 4: Resolution, Consequences &amp; Debrief (30-40 minutes)\n\nDecisions are locked in.\nThe facilitator narrates outcomes based on a mix of logic, known international relations dynamics, and randomized risk-style consequences.\nPoints or advantages are awarded for:\n\nAchieving national goals\nEffective alliances\nCrisis mitigation\nPersuasive diplomacy\n\n\nThe session ends with a quick debrief and highlights for the next round.\n\n\n5. Roles\n\nChairperson / Moderator: Designs the weekly scenario, introduces rules, controls the flow, interprets consequences, and facilitates fair play.\nCountry/Entity Representatives: Represent the interests of their assigned roles. These can change each week or persist depending on format.\nObservers/Analysts (optional): Track discussions and provide feedback.\n\n\n6. Participant Rotation &amp; Progression\n\nRotating countries and roles ensure varied learning experiences.\nA points-based leaderboard can track strategic success across weeks.\n“Veteran” players may become special envoys, bloc leaders, or simulation assistants.\n\n\n7. Tools &amp; Materials\n\nScenario brief templates\nCountry/entity info sheets\nRisk-style action/event cards (for randomness)\nDigital dashboard or whiteboard (for public moves, alliances, crises)\nSimple scoring system for participation, strategy, diplomacy, and creativity\n\n\n8. Ideal Group Size\n\n6 to 15 participants per session (scalable with breakout rooms or multi-bloc formats)\n\n\n9. Target Audience\n\nUniversity students, policy enthusiasts, aspiring diplomats, debaters, gamers interested in politics, and anyone curious about global affairs.\n\n\n10. Long-Term Vision\n\nDevelop the simulation into a club or chapter-based program.\nRecord and share simulation recaps to raise awareness and encourage learning.\nIntroduce guest speakers or “wildcard” characters (e.g., whistleblowers, journalists, rogue hackers) to spice up future sessions.\n"},"EG-Publishers/GASS/🕊️-Global-Affairs-Simulation-Series-(GASS)-Handbook":{"slug":"EG-Publishers/GASS/🕊️-Global-Affairs-Simulation-Series-(GASS)-Handbook","filePath":"EG Publishers/GASS/🕊️ Global Affairs Simulation Series (GASS) Handbook.md","title":"🕊️ Global Affairs Simulation Series (GASS) Handbook","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"A weekly geopolitical simulation experience\n\n🔱 Role 1: Chairperson / Moderator\n🌐 Description\nYou are the engine behind the simulation. As Chairperson, you craft the world scenario, manage session flow, enforce rules, and guide outcomes. Think of yourself as a hybrid of a Game Master and UN Secretary-General. Your role is to maintain balance, drive engagement, and create space for meaningful diplomacy and calculated risk-taking.\n🎯 Primary Objective\nFacilitate a coherent, engaging, and fair simulation session where all parties are challenged and immersed.\n🧠 Preparation\n\nDesign a Scenario Brief: A 1-2 paragraph situation (e.g., a food crisis, tech war, or territorial dispute).\nOutline Goals for Each Role: Tailor these based on the scenario, or pull from pre-made templates.\nPrepare Event Cards (Optional): Wildcard developments—market crashes, coups, natural disasters.\nDecide if roles will carry over week to week or reset.\n\n🛠️ Responsibilities During Session\n\nSet up and present the Scenario Brief.\nAssign or confirm participant roles.\nModerate General Assembly, enforce speaking limits, manage conflicts.\nInterpret consequences of decisions, including use of randomizers (e.g., dice rolls for war outcomes).\nOffer subtle nudges or new info to keep sessions dynamic.\n\n📌 Tips for Success\n\nKeep a time tracker.\nBuild tension by releasing new info mid-session.\nMaintain neutrality. If you must intervene, do so as a “world system” rather than as a player.\n\n\n🌍 Role 2: Country / Entity Representative\n🌐 Description\nYou represent a global power—whether it’s a nation-state, multinational corporation, alliance, or rebel group. Your task is to protect your interests, manage alliances, negotiate, and react strategically to crises. You are the diplomat, general, economist, and spokesperson all rolled into one.\n🎯 Primary Objective\nAdvance your entity’s interests in a way that aligns with the scenario. Win influence, power, or stability through strategy, diplomacy, or confrontation.\n🧠 Preparation\n\nReview the Scenario Brief.\nRead your Entity Info Sheet, which includes:\n\nBackground\nKey Interests\nStrengths and Weaknesses\nKnown Allies or Enemies\nHidden Agenda (optional)\n\n\nCome prepared with a basic strategy or set of opening goals.\nResearch your real-world counterpart if applicable.\n\n🎭 In-Session Duties\n\nSpeak during assemblies, respond to crises, and propose solutions.\nForm alliances, make deals, and lobby others during negotiation phase.\nParticipate in or oppose joint resolutions, treaties, or sanctions.\nTake risks when needed, but always consider long-term consequences.\n\n🛠️ Tools at Your Disposal\n\nStrategic alliances\nNegotiation deals (verbal or written)\nMilitary action or threats (if allowed)\nEconomic moves (tariffs, resource trading, embargoes)\nInfluence and persuasion\n\n📌 Tips for Success\n\nListen carefully—intel is often hidden in others’ statements.\nBuild rapport with allies early.\nThink in terms of trade-offs, not total wins.\nBe persuasive, not loud. Diplomacy trumps drama.\n\n\n🕵️ Role 3: Observer / Analyst (Optional)\n🌐 Description\nObservers play the role of media outlets, think tanks, or intelligence agencies. While not active negotiators, you provide critical outside perspectives that influence the game subtly. Think of yourself as a journalist, fact-checker, or behind-the-scenes analyst who can shift narratives with the power of reporting.\n🎯 Primary Objective\nMonitor developments, spot patterns, raise questions, and document key moves. You may occasionally leak information, publish reports, or expose secret alliances.\n🧠 Preparation\n\nRead the Scenario Brief and understand potential flashpoints.\nPrepare a digital or physical notepad for live updates and observations.\nCoordinate with the Chairperson if you plan to introduce leaks or news updates mid-session.\n\n🛠️ Responsibilities\n\nRecord major declarations, conflicts, alliances, and betrayals.\nProvide one or two “news updates” during the simulation, read aloud or posted publicly.\nSummarize the outcome at the end, optionally providing “winners” or standout moves.\nIn recurring formats, maintain a logbook of events.\n\n📌 Tips for Success\n\nStay neutral, but not silent.\nUse dramatic language to stir tension.\nReport with impact: Headlines matter more than paragraphs.\n\n\n🧩 Additional Role Ideas (Advanced / Optional)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRole TypeDescriptionNGO or Climate CoalitionAdvocate for human rights, environment, or public health.
