## ✅ 1. PLANNING & PREP

### 🔸 **Decide the MVP Format**

- **Participants:** 5–8 is ideal for an MVP. Any more and you’ll need more time or helpers.
    
- **Role Types:** Stick to mostly **country reps**, plus 1 **corporation** or wildcard role, and **1 chairperson** (you).
    
- **Session Length:** 2 hours max—keep it tight and engaging.
    
- **Simulation Type:** Use one strong, well-structured scenario (like “Shadow Over the Strait”).
    

### 🔸 **Choose Your Platform (if online)**

- Zoom / Google Meet for discussion
    
- Breakout rooms for private negotiations
    
- Google Docs or Notion for shared info sheets
    
- Chat app (Telegram, Discord) for backchannels (optional)

## 🎯 BONUS: MVP Success Tips

- **Keep things moving.** Timebox hard. MVP = lean and fun.
    
- **Prioritize immersion over rules.** It’s okay if not everything is fair or “balanced.”
    
- **Document the session.** Take notes or record—it’ll help refine the next round.
    
- **Invite feedback.** Make a post-session form or ask 3 questions:
    
    - What did you enjoy the most?
        
    - What confused you?
        
    - What would you change for next time?
