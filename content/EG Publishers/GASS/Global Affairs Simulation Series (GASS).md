**Concept Note: Global Affairs Simulation Series (GASS)**  
**Format:** Weekly 2-Hour Interactive Simulation  
**Inspired by:** Model United Nations, _Risk_, _Diplomacy_, and real-world international relations

---
### **1. Overview**

The _Global Affairs Simulation Series_ (GASS) is a weekly, fast-paced simulation that replicates current international political dynamics, crises, negotiations, and power plays. Participants role-play as nations, corporations, or major geopolitical actors (e.g., UN bodies, rebel groups, multinational corporations, etc.) and engage in high-stakes decision-making shaped by real-time global events.

The goal is to foster critical thinking, negotiation skills, geopolitical awareness, and collaborative strategy—all in a dynamic and gamified format.

---
### **2. Objectives**

- Promote understanding of international relations and global power structures.
- Provide participants with a platform to practice public speaking, diplomacy, and strategic thinking.
- Explore current world events through immersive simulation.
- Encourage collaboration and healthy debate among diverse perspectives.

---
### **3. Frequency & Duration**

- **Schedule:** Weekly (e.g., every Friday at 5:00 PM)
- **Duration:** 2 Hours per session

---
### **4. Format & Phases**

Each simulation follows a structured format with real-world references, game mechanics, and roleplay elements. The structure is modular and allows for flexibility based on global headlines or planned scenarios.

#### **Phase 1: Briefing & World Setup (20 minutes)**

- The Chairperson introduces the week’s **scenario**, which reflects real-world tensions (e.g., regional conflicts, climate agreements, cyberattacks, resource shortages).
- Each participant receives a **quick brief** on their country/entity’s current position, interests, resources, and constraints.
- Alliances and previous session impacts (if applicable) are acknowledged.

#### **Phase 2: Strategic Planning & Negotiation (30 minutes)**

- Players form alliances, make deals, exchange intel, or set up multilateral talks.
- Bilateral or multilateral discussions are encouraged in breakout formats.
- This phase may include secret messages or back-channel diplomacy (optional, depending on format).

#### **Phase 3: General Assembly / Crisis Response (30 minutes)**

- Each representative speaks on their proposed action or stance (2-3 min max).
- Joint resolutions, declarations, or responses to the scenario are drafted.
- Emergency motions or vetoes may be introduced.
- Real-time developments (like surprise attacks or market crashes) may be introduced by the Chairperson based on dice rolls or cards (Risk-style twist).

#### **Phase 4: Resolution, Consequences & Debrief (30-40 minutes)**

- Decisions are locked in.
- The facilitator narrates outcomes based on a mix of logic, known international relations dynamics, and randomized risk-style consequences.
- Points or advantages are awarded for:
    - Achieving national goals
    - Effective alliances
    - Crisis mitigation
    - Persuasive diplomacy
- The session ends with a quick debrief and highlights for the next round.

---
### **5. Roles**

- **Chairperson / Moderator:** Designs the weekly scenario, introduces rules, controls the flow, interprets consequences, and facilitates fair play.
- **Country/Entity Representatives:** Represent the interests of their assigned roles. These can change each week or persist depending on format.
- **Observers/Analysts (optional):** Track discussions and provide feedback.

---
### **6. Participant Rotation & Progression**

- Rotating countries and roles ensure varied learning experiences.
- A points-based leaderboard can track strategic success across weeks.
- “Veteran” players may become special envoys, bloc leaders, or simulation assistants.

---
### **7. Tools & Materials**

- Scenario brief templates
- Country/entity info sheets
- Risk-style action/event cards (for randomness)
- Digital dashboard or whiteboard (for public moves, alliances, crises)
- Simple scoring system for participation, strategy, diplomacy, and creativity

---
### **8. Ideal Group Size**

- 6 to 15 participants per session (scalable with breakout rooms or multi-bloc formats)

---
### **9. Target Audience**

- University students, policy enthusiasts, aspiring diplomats, debaters, gamers interested in politics, and anyone curious about global affairs.

---
### **10. Long-Term Vision**

- Develop the simulation into a club or chapter-based program.
- Record and share simulation recaps to raise awareness and encourage learning.
- Introduce guest speakers or “wildcard” characters (e.g., whistleblowers, journalists, rogue hackers) to spice up future sessions.
