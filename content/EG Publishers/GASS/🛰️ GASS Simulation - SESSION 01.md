## **Scenario Title: “Shadow Over the Strait”**

---
## 🌍 GLOBAL SITUATION BRIEF

**Date:** April 2025  
**Setting:** The Bab el-Mandeb Strait, Red Sea Region

Tensions have reached a boiling point in one of the world’s most vital shipping lanes. A rogue drone attack has destroyed a major oil tanker off the coast of Djibouti. Pirate groups have claimed responsibility, but intelligence reports suggest involvement from state-backed actors.9


This comes at a time when:
- Global oil prices are spiking 📈
- China and the US are increasing naval presence 🚢
- The African Union is calling for calm, while Egypt and Saudi Arabia are mobilizing troops 🪖
- A powerful new AI-based surveillance network, owned by a private tech company, is capable of identifying the source of the attack—but they’re withholding data 💻

The world watches nervously as you enter the room. War is not inevitable—but neither is peace.
