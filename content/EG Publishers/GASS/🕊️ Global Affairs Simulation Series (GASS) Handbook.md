_A weekly geopolitical simulation experience_

---
## 🔱 Role 1: **Chairperson / Moderator**

### 🌐 **Description**

You are the engine behind the simulation. As Chairperson, you craft the world scenario, manage session flow, enforce rules, and guide outcomes. Think of yourself as a hybrid of a Game Master and UN Secretary-General. Your role is to maintain balance, drive engagement, and create space for meaningful diplomacy and calculated risk-taking.

### 🎯 **Primary Objective**

Facilitate a coherent, engaging, and fair simulation session where all parties are challenged and immersed.

### 🧠 **Preparation**

- Design a **Scenario Brief**: A 1-2 paragraph situation (e.g., a food crisis, tech war, or territorial dispute).
- Outline **Goals for Each Role**: Tailor these based on the scenario, or pull from pre-made templates.
- Prepare **Event Cards** (Optional): Wildcard developments—market crashes, coups, natural disasters.
- Decide if roles will **carry over** week to week or reset.

### 🛠️ **Responsibilities During Session**

- Set up and present the **Scenario Brief**.
- Assign or confirm participant roles.
- Moderate General Assembly, enforce speaking limits, manage conflicts.
- Interpret consequences of decisions, including use of randomizers (e.g., dice rolls for war outcomes).
- Offer subtle nudges or new info to keep sessions dynamic.

### 📌 **Tips for Success**

- Keep a time tracker.
- Build tension by releasing new info mid-session.
- Maintain neutrality. If you must intervene, do so as a "world system" rather than as a player.

## 🌍 Role 2: **Country / Entity Representative**

### 🌐 **Description**

You represent a global power—whether it's a **nation-state, multinational corporation, alliance, or rebel group**. Your task is to protect your interests, manage alliances, negotiate, and react strategically to crises. You are the diplomat, general, economist, and spokesperson all rolled into one.

### 🎯 **Primary Objective**

Advance your entity’s interests in a way that aligns with the scenario. Win influence, power, or stability through strategy, diplomacy, or confrontation.

### 🧠 **Preparation**

- Review the **Scenario Brief**.
- Read your **Entity Info Sheet**, which includes:
    - Background
    - Key Interests
    - Strengths and Weaknesses
    - Known Allies or Enemies
    - Hidden Agenda (optional)
- Come prepared with a basic strategy or set of opening goals.
- Research your real-world counterpart if applicable.

### 🎭 **In-Session Duties**

- Speak during assemblies, respond to crises, and propose solutions.
- Form alliances, make deals, and lobby others during negotiation phase.
- Participate in or oppose joint resolutions, treaties, or sanctions.
- Take risks when needed, but always consider long-term consequences.

### 🛠️ **Tools at Your Disposal**

- Strategic alliances
- Negotiation deals (verbal or written)
- Military action or threats (if allowed)
- Economic moves (tariffs, resource trading, embargoes)
- Influence and persuasion

### 📌 **Tips for Success**

- Listen carefully—intel is often hidden in others' statements.
- Build rapport with allies early.
- Think in terms of trade-offs, not total wins.
- Be persuasive, not loud. Diplomacy trumps drama.

## 🕵️ Role 3: **Observer / Analyst** _(Optional)_

### 🌐 **Description**

Observers play the role of media outlets, think tanks, or intelligence agencies. While not active negotiators, you provide critical outside perspectives that influence the game subtly. Think of yourself as a journalist, fact-checker, or behind-the-scenes analyst who can shift narratives with the power of reporting.

### 🎯 **Primary Objective**

Monitor developments, spot patterns, raise questions, and document key moves. You may occasionally leak information, publish reports, or expose secret alliances.

### 🧠 **Preparation**

- Read the **Scenario Brief** and understand potential flashpoints.
- Prepare a digital or physical notepad for live updates and observations.
- Coordinate with the Chairperson if you plan to introduce leaks or news updates mid-session.

### 🛠️ **Responsibilities**

- Record major declarations, conflicts, alliances, and betrayals.
- Provide one or two “news updates” during the simulation, read aloud or posted publicly.
- Summarize the outcome at the end, optionally providing “winners” or standout moves.
- In recurring formats, maintain a logbook of events.

### 📌 **Tips for Success**

- Stay neutral, but not silent.
- Use dramatic language to stir tension.
- Report with impact: Headlines matter more than paragraphs.
